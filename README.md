## Installation & Usage

To install this module `cd` to your project directory and enter the following command:
```
yarn add @react-native-community/slider
```
or
```
npm install @react-native-community/slider --save
```
If using iOS please remember to install cocoapods by running: `npx pod-install`
<br/>For web support please use `@react-native-community/slider@next`

The following code presents the basic usage scenario of this library:
```javascript
import Slider from '@react-native-community/slider';

<Slider
  style={{width: 200, height: 40}}
  minimumValue={0}
  maximumValue={1}
  minimumTrackTintColor="#FFFFFF"
  maximumTrackTintColor="#000000"
/>
```

Check out the [example project](example) for more examples.

**Migrating from the core `react-native` module**

This module was created when the Slider was split out from the core of React Native.
<br/>To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and then change you imports from:

```javascript
import { Slider } from 'react-native';
```

to:

```javascript
import Slider from '@react-native-community/slider';
```

## React Native Compatibility
To use this library you need to ensure you are using the correct version of React Native.

| `@react-native-community/slider` version | Required React Native Version |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `4.x.x`                                  | `>=0.60`; `>=0.62` (on Windows);  |
| `3.1.x`                                  | `>=0.60`                      |
| `2.x.x`                                  | `>= 0.60`                     |

| `maximumValue` | Initial maximum value of the slider.<br/>Default value is 1. | number | No | |
| `minimumTrackTintColor` | The color used for the track to the left of the button.<br/>Overrides the default blue gradient image on iOS. | [color](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors) | No | |
| `minimumValue` | Initial minimum value of the slider.<br/>Default value is 0. | number | No | |
| `onSlidingStart` | Callback that is called when the user picks up the slider.<br/>The initial value is passed as an argument to the callback handler. | function | No | |
| `onSlidingComplete` | Callback that is called when the user releases the slider, regardless if the value has changed.<br/>The current value is passed as an argument to the callback handler. | function | No | |
| `onValueChange` | Callback continuously called while the user is dragging the slider. | function | No | |
| `step` | Step value of the slider. The value should be between 0 and (maximumValue - minimumValue). Default value is 0.<br/>On Windows OS the default value is 1% of slider's range (from `minimumValue` to `maximumValue`). | number | No | |

## Roadmap and Progress

There's a Project board available [here](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/projects/1) which contains all reported issues organized into columns regarding their status.

If you are interested in knowing whether the issue you reported is handled or just to check the status of a feature you would like to have in Slider, please check the board.

## Contributing

The main package implementation is done in the `package/` directory.
So when implementing changes there, make sure your code passes ESLint and the tests. Run the following to verify:
```sh
cd package/
npm run lint
npm run test
```

* Remember to cover your changes with tests if possible.

When [creating an issue](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider/issues/new/choose) please remember to specify the platform which the issue occurs on.

## Running the example app 
While developing, you can run the example app to test your changes.

### Setup

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run example-<platform>`, where platform can be: `ios`, `android`, `windows`

You can also do this manually by:
- Installing node modules for example app
- Installing pods for iOS app
- Running example app like always: `npx react-native run-<platform>`

### New architecture setup (Fabric)

In order to use the new architecture some extra steps are needed. 
#### iOS 
- Install pods with new arch flag inside `example/ios` folder: `RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install`
- Run `npm run example-ios`

#### Android 
- Set `newArchEnabled` to true inside `example/android/gradle.properties`
- Run `npm run example-android`

If you are using React Native version lower than 0.70, you need to setup manual linking for Android to work.
